This repository houses a periodically updated list of websites (root domains only) that are decidedly known to be blocked on Airtel Fiber's network. A current list of blocked hostnames can be found [here](https://github.com/captn3m0/blocked-hosts/blob/main/compiled_block_list.txt). Historic results are available in the `output` directory.

**Note:** The lists published here are not fully representative of all hostnames that might be blocked by Airtel Fiber at a given time.
